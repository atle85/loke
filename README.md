Install required modules into a virtualenv (python3) by using pip -r requirements.txt

To choose what modules to be used, comment/uncomment in main.py (both import-statements and the lines where they are used).
Also make sure you change the name config.py-sample, as well as the the files in the data/-folder so they will be usable.
